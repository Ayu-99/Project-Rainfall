# Project-Rainfall Analysis and Prediction

### This project is divided into three parts : 

#### The first part is Data Analysis.. It can show the analysis in form of graphs(using library Matplotlib) :-

- Rainfall in specific state in specific year
- Compare rainfall for two states 
- Show the rainfall of India(year:2000-2017) in a specific year
- Compare rainfall of India for two particular years


#### The second part is States classification.. This is done using Machine Learning ( skLearn : Decision Tree Classifier)

- It can classify different states on basis of less rainfall, moderate rainfall and heavy rainfall state!!!

#### The third part is Rainfall Prediction.. This is done using Machine Learning ( skLearn : Linear Regression)

- It can predict the rainfall for any state for overall year. Model is trained by rainfall data from 2000 to 2017 in each and every month 
- It can also predict the rainfall for any month for a state  in any year...
